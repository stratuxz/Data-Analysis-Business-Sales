# Data Analysis Business Sales
 Project scenario 

This is a demonstration/conceptual project takes a fictional scenario that represents a real life problem.

A sales manager wants a visual dashboard that gives details about the overall sales, information about the customers, and information about the products sold.
The data that was used was from Microsoft's sample database: AdventureWorks23. 
I used SQL server to load up the database and from there I looked at the tables that provided data needed for extraction.
